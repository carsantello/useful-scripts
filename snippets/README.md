# Snippets
Useful lines of code you didn't know you needed!

## What are snippets?
Snippet is a programming term for a **small region of re-usable source code**, machine code, or text. Ordinarily, these are formally defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules. Snippet management is a feature of some text editors, program source code editors, IDEs, and related software.

##### Snippets in text editors
Text editors that include this feature ordinarily provide a mechanism to manage the catalogue, and separate "snippets" in the same manner that the text editor and operating system allow management of separate files. These basic management abilities include operations such as viewing, adding, editing, deleting, sorting, filtering, grouping, renaming, and storing snippets in a repository, catalogue, or database.
##### Snippets in IDEs
Some programmer's applications such as Eclipse, NetBeans, and Microsoft's Visual Studio and other IDEs include built-in parts of structure for ease of coding. Other applications such as Macromedia Dreamweaver make use of these code snippets as well for Web development.
##### Snippets in JIT compilers
Just-in-time (JIT) compilers can "splice together" pre-compiled sections of code as longer object code/machine code segments. This reduces interpret time significantly and simultaneously speeds execution.

```
temp = $1
$1 = $2
$2 = temp
```
